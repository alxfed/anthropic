 "This is another in which ‘run’ might be used, and in each of them ‘run’ will, or at least can, mean something different. This is not to say that one can never legitimately\n\nspeak of a term or expression ‘having a meaning’—Gadamer himself does this frequently, and we will do so as well. But it does mean that we must be attentive to what this locution does and does not imply. It does not refer to something already fixed and determinate, but rather to something like an ever-shifting semantic potential that an expression carries."
